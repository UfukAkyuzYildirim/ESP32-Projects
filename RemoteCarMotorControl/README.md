# RemoteCarMotorControl

This is a new PlatformIO + ESP-IDF project scaffold.

- No application source code has been added yet (we'll implement step-by-step).
- Target board: `esp32dev` (same as the existing projects in this repo).

## Next (when you say "go")
- Add `src/main.c` or `src/main.cpp` with a minimal `app_main()`.
- Then implement a BTS7960B motor driver wrapper + safe stop/timeout logic.
